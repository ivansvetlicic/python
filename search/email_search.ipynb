I am on vacation next week, so \\nhere are my current thoughts.  I am contactable on my mobile if necessary.\\n\\nGas to power correlations\\n I see your point about gas to power correlation only affecting VAR for the \\ncombined gas and power portfolio, and this raises an interesting point:  At a \\nconservative 30% long term correlation, combined VAR is o1mm less than \\npreviously expected - so how does this affect the limit breach?  Strictly \\nspeaking, we are still over our UK power limit, but the limit was set when we \\nwere assuming no gas power correlation and therefore a higher portfolio VAR.  \\n\\nA suggested way forward given the importance of the spread options to the UK \\nGas and Power books- \\ncan we allocate to the gas and power books a share of the reduction in \\nportfolio VAR  - ie [Reduction = Portfolio VAR - sum(Power VAR + Gas VAR)]?\\n\\nAlso, if I understand your mail correctly, Matrix 1 implies 55% gas power \\ncorrelation is consistent with our correlation curves, and this reduces total \\nVAR by o1.8mm.\\n\\nEFA slot correlations\\nThe issue of whether our existing EFA to EFA correlation matrix is correct is \\na separate issue.  I don't understand where the Matrix 2 EFA to EFA \\ncorrelations come from, but I am happy for you to run some historical \\ncorrelations from the forward curves (use the first 2 years, I would \\nsuggest).  Our original matrix was based on historicals, but the analysis is \\nworth doing again.  Your matrix 2 results certainly indicate how important \\nthese correlations are.\\n\\nClosing thoughts\\nFriday's trading left us longer so I would not expect a limit breach on \\nMonday.  We are still reviewing the shape of the long term curve, and I'd \\nlike to wait until both Simon Hastings and I are back in the office (Monday \\nweek) before finalising this.\\n \\nRegards\\n\\nRichard\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nTanya Tamarchenko\\n06/10/2000 22:59\\nTo: Oliver Gaylard/LON/ECT@ECT, Richard Lewis/LON/ECT@ECT, James \\nNew/LON/ECT@ECT, Steven Leppard/LON/ECT@ECT, Rudy Dautel/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kirstee \\nHewitt/LON/ECT@ECT, Naveen Andrews/Corp/Enron@ENRON, David Port/Market \\nRisk/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT\\ncc:  \\n\\nSubject: Re: VaR correlation scenarios  \\n\\nEverybody,\\nOliver  sent us the VAR number for different correlations for UK-Power \\nportfolio separately from UK-Gas portfolio.\\n\\nFirst, if VAR is calculated accurately the correlation between Power and Gas \\ncurves should not affect VAR number for Power and VAR number for Gas, only \\nthe aggregate number will be affected. The changes you see are due to the \\nfact that we use Monte-Carlo simulation method,\\nwhich accuracy depends on the number of simulations. Even if we don't change \\nthe correlations but use different realizations of random numbers,\\nwe get slightly different result from the model.\\n\\nSo: to see the effect of using different correlations between Gas and Power \\nwe should look at the aggregate number.\\n\\nI calculated weighted correlations based on 2 curves I got from Paul. As the \\nweights along the term structure I used the product of price, position and \\nvolatility for each time bucket for Gas and each of EFA slots. The results \\nare shown below:\\n\\n\\nInserting these numbers into the original correlation matrix produced \\nnegatively definite correlation matrix, which brakes VAR engine. \\nCorrelation matrix for any set of random variables is non-negative by \\ndefinition, and remains non-negatively definite if calculated properly based \\non any historical data.\\nHere, according to our phone discussion, we started experimenting with \\ncorrelations, assuming the same correlation for each EFA slot and ET Elec \\nversus Gas. I am sending you the spreadsheet which summaries the results. In \\naddition to the aggregate VAR numbers for the runs Oliver did, you can see \\nthe VAR numbers based on correlation Matrix 1 and Matrix 2. In Matrix 1 the \\ncorrelations across EFA slots are identical to these in original matrix.\\nI obtained this matrix by trial and error. Matrix 2 is produces by Naveen \\nusing Finger's algorithm, it differs from original matrix across EFA slots as \\nwell\\nas in Power versus Gas correlations and gives higher VAR than matrix 1 does. \\n\\nConcluding: we will look at the historical forward prices and try to \\ncalculate historical correlations from them.\\n\\nTanya.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOliver Gaylard\\n10/06/2000 01:50 PM\\nTo: Richard Lewis/LON/ECT@ECT, James New/LON/ECT@ECT, Steven \\nLeppard/LON/ECT@ECT, Rudy Dautel/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kirstee Hewitt/LON/ECT@ECT, \\nNaveen Andrews/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Tanya Tamarchenko/HOU/ECT@ECT, David \\nPort/Market Risk/Corp/Enron@ENRON\\ncc:  \\nSubject: VaR correlation scenarios\\n\\nThe results were as follows when changing the gas/power correlations:\\n\\nCorrelation  VaR-UK Power book       VaR- UK Gas book\\n 0.0  o10.405MM       o3.180MM\\n 0.1  o10.134MM       o3.197MM\\n 0.2  o10.270MM       o3.185MM\\n 0.3  o10.030MM       o3.245MM\\n 0.4  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)\\n 0.5  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)\\n 0.6  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)\\n 0.7  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)\\n 0.8  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)\\n 0.9  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)\\n 1.0  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)\\n \\nPeaks and off peaks were treated the same to avoid violating the matrix's \\nintegrity. \\n\\nInteresting to note that for a higher correlation of 0.2 the power VaR \\nincreases which is counter to intuition.  This implies that we need to look \\ninto how the correlations are being applied within the model.

My schedule melted down after we talked on Monday.  Here's \\nwhere folks came out.  There's some concern about size.  We're supposed to be \\nno larger than 3, but we lobbied Aceves and he apparently Ok'd our \\n\"oversized\" group.  The other folks in the group--who talked to him \\noriginally--are pretty sure that five will violate the rules.  Folks wondered \\nif there were other groups that are smaller than ours that you could hook up \\nwith.  Sorry about that---it's a wrinkle that I didn't think about when we \\nspoke.  If it gets real ugly trying to find a smaller group, let me know.  \\nFortunately there's not another team case due for two weeks.\\n\\nBest,\\nJeff   \n",

I am on vacation next week, so \\nhere are my current thoughts.  I am contactable on my mobile if necessary.\\n\\nGas to power correlations\\n I see your point about gas to power correlation only affecting VAR for the \\ncombined gas and power portfolio, and this raises an interesting point:  At a \\nconservative 30% long term correlation, combined VAR is o1mm less than \\npreviously expected - so how does this affect the limit breach?  Strictly \\nspeaking, we are still over our UK power limit, but the limit was set when we \\nwere assuming no gas power correlation and therefore a higher portfolio VAR.  \\n\\nA suggested way forward given the importance of the spread options to the UK \\nGas and Power books- \\ncan we allocate to the gas and power books a share of the reduction in \\nportfolio VAR  - ie [Reduction = Portfolio VAR - sum(Power VAR + Gas VAR)]?\\n\\nAlso, if I understand your mail correctly, Matrix 1 implies 55% gas power \\ncorrelation is consistent with our correlation curves, and this reduces total \\nVAR by o1.8mm.\\n\\nEFA slot correlations\\nThe issue of whether our existing EFA to EFA correlation matrix is correct is \\na separate issue.  I don't understand where the Matrix 2 EFA to EFA \\ncorrelations come from, but I am happy for you to run some historical \\ncorrelations from the forward curves (use the first 2 years, I would \\nsuggest).  Our original matrix was based on historicals, but the analysis is \\nworth doing again.  Your matrix 2 results certainly indicate how important \\nthese correlations are.\\n\\nClosing thoughts\\nFriday's trading left us longer so I would not expect a limit breach on \\nMonday.  We are still reviewing the shape of the long term curve, and I'd \\nlike to wait until both Simon Hastings and I are back in the office (Monday \\nweek) before finalising this.\\n \\nRegards\\n\\nRichard\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nTanya Tamarchenko\\n06/10/2000 22:59\\nTo: Oliver Gaylard/LON/ECT@ECT, Richard Lewis/LON/ECT@ECT, James \\nNew/LON/ECT@ECT, Steven Leppard/LON/ECT@ECT, Rudy Dautel/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kirstee \\nHewitt/LON/ECT@ECT, Naveen Andrews/Corp/Enron@ENRON, David Port/Market \\nRisk/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT\\ncc:  \\n\\nSubject: Re: VaR correlation scenarios  \\n\\nEverybody,\\nOliver  sent us the VAR number for different correlations for UK-Power \\nportfolio separately from UK-Gas portfolio.\\n\\nFirst, if VAR is calculated accurately the correlation between Power and Gas \\ncurves should not affect VAR number for Power and VAR number for Gas, only \\nthe aggregate number will be affected. The changes you see are due to the \\nfact that we use Monte-Carlo simulation method,\\nwhich accuracy depends on the number of simulations. Even if we don't change \\nthe correlations but use different realizations of random numbers,\\nwe get slightly different result from the model.\\n\\nSo: to see the effect of using different correlations between Gas and Power \\nwe should look at the aggregate number.\\n\\nI calculated weighted correlations based on 2 curves I got from Paul. As the \\nweights along the term structure I used the product of price, position and \\nvolatility for each time bucket for Gas and each of EFA slots. The results \\nare shown below:\\n\\n\\nInserting these numbers into the original correlation matrix produced \\nnegatively definite correlation matrix, which brakes VAR engine. \\nCorrelation matrix for any set of random variables is non-negative by \\ndefinition, and remains non-negatively definite if calculated properly based \\non any historical data.\\nHere, according to our phone discussion, we started experimenting with \\ncorrelations, assuming the same correlation for each EFA slot and ET Elec \\nversus Gas. I am sending you the spreadsheet which summaries the results. In \\naddition to the aggregate VAR numbers for the runs Oliver did, you can see \\nthe VAR numbers based on correlation Matrix 1 and Matrix 2. In Matrix 1 the \\ncorrelations across EFA slots are identical to these in original matrix.\\nI obtained this matrix by trial and error. Matrix 2 is produces by Naveen \\nusing Finger's algorithm, it differs from original matrix across EFA slots as \\nwell\\nas in Power versus Gas correlations and gives higher VAR than matrix 1 does. \\n\\nConcluding: we will look at the historical forward prices and try to \\ncalculate historical correlations from them.\\n\\nTanya.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOliver Gaylard\\n10/06/2000 01:50 PM\\nTo: Richard Lewis/LON/ECT@ECT, James New/LON/ECT@ECT, Steven \\nLeppard/LON/ECT@ECT, Rudy Dautel/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kirstee Hewitt/LON/ECT@ECT, \\nNaveen Andrews/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Tanya Tamarchenko/HOU/ECT@ECT, David \\nPort/Market Risk/Corp/Enron@ENRON\\ncc:  \\nSubject: VaR correlation scenarios\\n\\nThe results were as follows when changing the gas/power correlations:\\n\\nCorrelation  VaR-UK Power book       VaR- UK Gas book\\n 0.0  o10.405MM       o3.180MM\\n 0.1  o10.134MM       o3.197MM\\n 0.2  o10.270MM       o3.185MM\\n 0.3  o10.030MM       o3.245MM\\n 0.4  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)\\n 0.5  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)\\n 0.6  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)\\n 0.7  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)\\n 0.8  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)\\n 0.9  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)\\n 1.0  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)\\n \\nPeaks and off peaks were treated the same to avoid violating the matrix's \\nintegrity. \\n\\nInteresting to note that for a higher correlation of 0.2 the power VaR \\nincreases which is counter to intuition.

Change Order #5--Pleasanton Transformer\\n\\nA redraft of Change Order #5 to the LM 6000 contract to provide for the \\npurchase of a GE transformer for the Pleasanton project is attached.  \\n\\nPlease note that I have added some guaranty/LD provisions in Exhibit A, and \\nconfirm whether these are appropriate in scope and amount.\\n\\nWe will attach the documents included here as separate files as Exhibits B \\nand C.  I understand that GE is to provide a more current copy of their \\nstandard specifications for the transformer to be included in the Exhibits.\\n\\n\\nKathleen:  Kay tells me that you are the keeper of change orders.  \\nCongratulations!!  The discussion of current amount balances, etc. in the \\nattached are clearly wrong if we are up to CO#5--it was all based on this \\nbeing the third CO.  Can you please let me know what the right numbers should \\nbe?\\n\\nThanks in advance for your input.  I understand there is some urgency with \\ngetting this out.\\n\\n\\n   \n",

I look for trainability as well.  \\n\\nMy questions:\\n-What do you know about the commodities market?\\n-Do you do any online trading, if so what, and why - looking for trading of \\noptions,  stocks, futs, etc for more difficult follow-up questions like\\n    why options, not buy/sell the underlying.  How do you determine what to \\ntrade and when, how long do you hold it.  Also looking for how often they \\nplay        on the internet and whether they do it at work.  \\n-What do you know about the industry?  How many units in a contract?  How do \\nyou hedge physical gas?  Financial positions?  \\n-What is V@R?  Not looking for a technical answer, just if they are familiar \\nwith the concept?  What other trading controls do they expect to be in place?\\n-How well do you handle ridicule?  (Always looking for a certain central \\ntrader's new lackey)\\n-How well versed are you in Excel?  What have you done where you are using \\nexcel to improve your work product?  How did you learn it?  Have you shared \\nit with anyone else?  What other improvements have you made?  Would you give \\nme a name of a person I could verify the impact this has had in your current \\norganization?  (I don't ever call, I just am looking to see if there answer \\nis the truth and what kind of ego they have) \\n-Further educational goals?  MBA, CFA,  - looking for goals and motivators.\\n-Are you easily incited to violence?\\n\\nWK\\n\\n\\n---------------------- Forwarded by William Kelly/HOU/ECT on 12/27/2000 10:42 \\nAM ---------------------------\\n   \\n\\tEnron Capital Management\\n\\t\\n\\tFrom:  David Baumbach                           12/27/2000 09:49 AM\\n\\t\\n\\nTo: Jeffrey C Gossett/HOU/ECT@ECT\\ncc: Kam Keiser/HOU/ECT@ECT, William Kelly/HOU/ECT@ECT, Darron C \\nGiron/HOU/ECT@ECT, Errol McLaughlin/Corp/Enron@ENRON \\nSubject: Technical Questions\\n\\nI do not have very many technical questions but here a the few that I have \\nused:\\n\\n- Do you understand what curveshift is?  If so ... Price today was $10.20 and \\nyesterday it was $10.13 ... what was my curveshift?\\n- What makes up a P&amp;L statement?\\n- What is MTM accounting?  accrual accounting?\\n- If they have knowledge of options, what is a delta position?\\n\\nI guess these are more general analytical questions:\\n\\n- Give me an example of an problem you've had and how you solved it?\\n- The \"eight ball\" question (basic problem solving)\\n- The \"light switch\" question (advanced problem solving)\\n\\nWhen I interview I am looking for trainability, better than average problem \\nsolving skills and a desire to work in this environment.  If the candidate \\nhas these skills then I believe we can teach them what they need to know.  I \\nalso think it is candidates with these basic attributes that are a better fit \\nfor us.

At this level we can then break things out into the required subfolders (e.g. accounting, trading, legal, ...). \\n\\nIn this regard we have set up the I:/Newco/ directory and started to create subfolders.

Houston has requested that we make lists of all applications that we use and also that we consolidate all of the files (models and data) that are critical to our business (I don't think MP3's count) into one directory on the network. This is so that these items can be included in the proposed deal with newco. The Calgary Trading group has set up a directory on I:/trading/newco and I think if each group did the same that would be great.

I look for trainability as well.  \\n\\nMy questions:\\n-What do you know about the commodities market?\\n-Do you do any online trading, if so what, and why - looking for trading of \\noptions,  stocks, futs, etc for more difficult follow-up questions like\\n    why options, not buy/sell the underlying.  How do you determine what to \\ntrade and when, how long do you hold it.  Also looking for how often they \\nplay        on the internet and whether they do it at work.  \\n-What do you know about the industry?  How many units in a contract?  How do \\nyou hedge physical gas?  Financial positions?  \\n-What is V@R?  Not looking for a technical answer, just if they are familiar \\nwith the concept?  What other trading controls do they expect to be in place?\\n-How well do you handle ridicule?  (Always looking for a certain central \\ntrader's new lackey)\\n-How well versed are you in Excel?  What have you done where you are using \\nexcel to improve your work product?  How did you learn it?  Have you shared \\nit with anyone else?  What other improvements have you made?  Would you give \\nme a name of a person I could verify the impact this has had in your current \\norganization?  (I don't ever call, I just am looking to see if there answer \\nis the truth and what kind of ego they have) \\n-Further educational goals?  MBA, CFA,  - looking for goals and motivators.\\n-Are you easily incited to violence?\\n\\nWK\\n\\n\\n---------------------- Forwarded by William Kelly/HOU/ECT on 12/27/2000 10:42 \\nAM ---------------------------\\n   \\n\\tEnron Capital Management\\n\\t\\n\\tFrom:  David Baumbach                           12/27/2000 09:49 AM\\n\\t\\n\\nTo: Jeffrey C Gossett/HOU/ECT@ECT\\ncc: Kam Keiser/HOU/ECT@ECT, William Kelly/HOU/ECT@ECT, Darron C \\nGiron/HOU/ECT@ECT, Errol McLaughlin/Corp/Enron@ENRON \\nSubject: Technical Questions\\n\\nI do not have very many technical questions but here a the few that I have \\nused:\\n\\n- Do you understand what curveshift is?

At this level we can then break things out into the required subfolders (e.g. accounting, trading, legal, ...). \\n\\nIn this regard we have set up the I:/Newco/ directory and started to create subfolders. I ask everyone who has put information in the I:/trading/newco directory to move it to  I:/Newco/ under their applicable subdirectory (which may need to be created).  I apologize that this is a hassle for those who have already transfered files.\\n\\nIf you have any concerns please let me know.\\n\\nRegards\\nChris\\n\\n -----Original Message-----\\nFrom: \\tDorland, Chris  \\nSent:\\tThursday, December 13, 2001 10:58 AM\\nTo:\\tHedstrom, Peggy; Scott, Laura; Zufferli, John; Le Dain, Eric; Davies, Derek; Keohane, Peter; Milnthorp, Rob; Devries, Paul; Gillis, Brian\\nCc:\\tBrodeur, Stephane; Clark, Chad; Richey, Cooper; Taylor, Michael J.; Taylor, Fabian; Draper, Lon; Cooke, Ian; Torres, Carlos; Lambie, Chris; Cowan, Mike; Watt, Ryan; Drozdiak, Dean; Hrap, Gerry; Oh, Grant; Laporte, Nicole; Dunsmore, Paul; Macphee, Mike; Biever, Jason; Otto, Randy; Johnston, Greg; Gaffney, Chris; Cappelletto, Nella; Dorland, Dan; Wilson, Jan; Rondeau, Clayton; Martin, Brad\\nSubject:\\tCritical Applications, Models and Data\\n\\nHi everyone!\\n\\nOnce again I find myself being tasked by Geof Storey. Houston has requested that we make lists of all applications that we use and also that we consolidate all of the files (models and data) that are critical to our business (I don't think MP3's count) into one directory on the network. This is so that these items can be included in the proposed deal with newco. The Calgary Trading group has set up a directory on I:/trading/newco and I think if each group did the same that would be great. Each group should probably have one person in charge of the directory so there isn't any overlap. Call me with any ?'s/\\n\\nThanx \\n\\nChris   \n",

I have spoken to Jim Saunders on the Accounting allocation.  He is sending 3% of his time for the accounting information flow to and from Co. 1195 as well as the investment accounting, and time spent on the reorganization accounting matters.  The remaining dollars of the accounting allocation are from Rod Hayslett for the time he is spending on Co. 1195 issues.  I hope this gives you the information you need.\\n\\tMary\\n\\n -----Original Message-----\\nFrom: \\tGeaccone, Tracy  \\nSent:\\tFriday, October 19, 2001 9:16 AM\\nTo:\\tBotello, Mary\\nSubject:\\tFW: Allocations\\n\\n\\n\\n -----Original Message-----\\nFrom: \\tJackson, Karl  \\nSent:\\tThursday, October 18, 2001 6:16 PM\\nTo:\\tGeaccone, Tracy\\nSubject:\\tAllocations\\n\\nI'm getting back to something, I left  you a message last week.  When Barney presented the ETS budget for the pipeline operations, he included amounts allocated from ETS for IT ($170k) and Accounting ($59k).  You left me a phone mail  message regarding the IT charge and suggested that I contact Caroline Barnes (which I did today).  Both of these appear to be new charges for 2002 and we'd like to get information on what they relate to.  Can you shed some light on the Accounting charge?\\n\\nThanks\\nKarl   \n",

INC. CAISO\\nSOL FERC02RMT22071\\nDUE 102601\\nPOC Charlotte Handley, 202-219-1156 or Andrew Sakallaris,202-219-1150\\nDESC: This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial\\n  items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6,\\n  as supplemented with additional information included in this\\n  notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation;\\n  proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will\\n  not be issued. FERC02RMT22071 is issued as a request for proposal\\n  and all provisions/clauses are those in effect through FAC\\n  97-27. This solicitation is unrestricted under NAICS number\\n  561. Statement of Work: I. BACKGROUND. The California electricity\\n  market has experienced great stress from Summer 2000 to Summer\\n  2001, with demand outstripping supply, wholesale prices rising\\n  dramatically, and key market participants becoming financially\\n  unstable. As a result, the California Independent System Operator,\\n  Inc. (CAISO), which operates the electricity transmission grid\\n  throughout most of California, was forced to adapt to rapidly\\n  changing circumstances. During all of this, the CAISO worked\\n  hard to ensure system reliability. Under the Federal Energy\\n  Regulatory Commission's market mitigation plan, wholesale prices\\n  stabilized in California in Summer 2001. The Commission seeks\\n  to take all appropriate steps for prospective improvements\\n  in California markets, including improvements to help the CAISO\\n  in effectively performing its increasing responsibilities.\\n  Accordingly, an independent operational audit of the CAISO\\n  will be performed to determine the areas, if any, in which\\n  the CAISO could enhance its effectiveness in fulfilling its\\n  responsibilities in operating the transmission system under\\n  its control and administering certain real-time energy markets.\\n  II. SCOPE OF WORK. The Independent Public Accounting (Contractor)\\n  firm shall perform an operational audit of the CAISO processes,\\n  practices, and procedures in accordance with Generally Accepted\\n  Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS). The Contractor shall\\n  provide a comparison of the CAISO's actual operations and its\\n  Commission tariff (procedures and tariff can be found at www.caiso.com).\\n  The Contractor shall ascertain whether the CAISO's operations\\n  are adequately transparent to market participants. To the extent\\n  possible, the Contractor shall also ascertain whether the CAISO's\\n  procedures and operations are consistent with the most effective\\n  business practice. III. AUDIT PERIOD. The audit of the CAISO\\n  shall cover the period commencing October 1, 2000, through\\n  October 1, 2001. IV. DELIVERABLES. The contractor must provide\\n  the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) with a draft\\n  and final report detailing the findings, operating deficiencies\\n  and/or major observations and recommendations. These reports\\n  and other deliverables must be provided to the COR by the close\\n  of business on the following dates: 1) Draft Report - January\\n  9, 2002 2) Final Report - January 16, 2002. V. SCHEDULE. The\\n  operational audit will commence on November 1, 2001, and it\\n  must be completed no later than January 4, 2002. The contractor\\n  shall meet with the COR to discuss the audit no later than\\n  November 6, 2001. The contractor must provide the Commission\\n  with an operational audit plan no later than November 14, 2001.\\n  A detailed operational audit plan will be submitted to the\\n  COR for review, feedback, and approval. The COR or designated\\n  representative will review the plan. VI. Working Papers. The\\n  contractor shall prepare and provide a copy of work papers\\n  in accordance with GAGAS. All work papers shall include the\\n  purpose, sources of information, the procedures performed,\\n  results thereof, and conclusions as appropriate for the planning,\\n  internal control, compliance, and substantive testing phases.\\n  For all findings, work papers shall clearly show the condition\\n  or problem, criteria, cause, effect, and recommendation for\\n  improvement. All working papers shall be cross-referenced to\\n  audit programs, summaries, and final audit report. These documents\\n  will become the property of the Commission. During the course\\n  of the audit or upon completion of the audit work, the Contractor's\\n  audit report and work papers shall be subject to access and\\n  review by the Commission. A preproposal conference is scheduled\\n  for prospective offerors at FERC on Tuesday, October 16, 2001,\\n  at 10:00 am at 888 First Street, NE, Washington, DC 20426,\\n  Room 3M-3.

Addendum to FAR\\n  52.212-1 SUBPARAGRAPH (b) Reply by e- mail the proposal to\\n  FERC, ATTN: C. Handley, Division of Procurement, FA-12, 888\\n  First St, NE, Wash DC 20426, e-mail: charlotte.handley@ferc.fed.us.\\n  It is our intent to evaluate based on initial proposals. Offerors\\n  shall submit five copies of their price and technical proposal,\\n  signed by an official authorized to bind the offeror, at the\\n  above address no later than 2:00 PM local time, Friday, October\\n  26, 2001.

Addendum to FAR 52.212-1 SUBPARAGRAPH (c) The offeror\\n  agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 calendar\\n  days. Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan\\n  1999), applies. Addendum to FAR 52.212-2 SUBPARAGRAPH, (a)\\n  Technical Proposal: Past Performance (30 points). Ensure that\\n  the company names, points of contact and phone numbers are\\n  current. The Offeror and each subcontractor proposed must each\\n  select three references to complete a \"Contractor Past-Performance\\n  Evaluation.\" All areas of the sheet must be filled in. If an\\n  answer to a specific question is not provided, the applicable\\n  area must be annotated with the reason why (e.g. \"Reference\\n  failed to provide an answer\"). Higher scores will be assigned\\n  for contracts that are at least similar in size and complexity.\\n  FERC may obtain and evaluate information from sources other\\n  than those provided by the offeror. FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv) states\\n  \"In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past\\n  performance or for whom information on past performance is\\n  not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or\\n  unfavorably on past performance.\" For the purposes of this\\n  evaluation not being evaluated favorably or unfavorably means\\n  the offeror will receive a rating of \"good or acceptable\" on\\n  company past performance. To obtain a copy of the past performance\\n  form to be completed by the Offeror's references, request from\\n  A. Sakallaris by email. The Offeror will be responsible and\\n  ensure that the references submit or reply by e-mail their\\n  completed response to C. Handley, located at the above address\\n  by 2:00 PM local time, October 26, 2001. Offerors should also\\n  notify the references that FERC may be contacting them regarding\\n  the past performance information. Prior Audit Experience (25\\n  points). The offeror must cover in its proposal the extent\\n  of prior related experience in electric bulk power markets,\\n  and the ability to effectively and efficiently conduct this\\n  operational audit in accordance with GAGAS. The proposal must\\n  include previous and/or current experience, within the last\\n  3 years, where the offeror has performed audits similar in\\n  terms of size and complexity of this requirement. Higher scores\\n  will be assigned to those offerors who have demonstrated successful\\n  experience in electric bulk power markets within the last three\\n  years. To be acceptable, the services must have been satisfactorily\\n  performed and at least similar in terms of size and complexity\\n  to the work required under this contract. Understanding the\\n  Statement of Work (20 points). The proposal must clearly demonstrate\\n  in sufficient and precise detail the offeror's expertise in\\n  understanding and analyzing independent system operator tariffs,\\n  market operations and services, and transmission issues. The\\n  offeror must describe its ability to perform a comprehensive\\n  and thorough analysis of the electric bulk power market operated\\n  by the CAISO. Higher scores will be assigned to those offerors\\n  who demonstrate an understanding and greater knowledge of independent\\n  system operator tariffs, market operations and services, and\\n  transmission issues. Higher scores will also be assigned to\\n  offerors who demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of bulk\\n  power markets like those operated by the CAISO. Audit Methodology\\n  and Quality Control (15 points). The technical proposal must\\n  include the audit methodology and must address each phase of\\n  the audit. The proposal must identify specific aspects of each\\n  phase and explain how each phase/aspect is related. The offeror\\n  must include estimated completion times for each phase of the\\n  audit and address critical completion dates. The technical\\n  proposal must describe the audit approach to documenting systems\\n  and internal controls, and effective procedures, including\\n  consideration of risk and materiality, to determine the extent\\n  of audit testing. Quality control is an important part of the\\n  technical proposal. The proposal must demonstrate the offeror's\\n  internal quality control procedures. The proposal must include\\n  a copy of the firm's latest peer review report, comments, and\\n  the response to the peer review report. Higher scores will\\n  be assigned to those offerors who demonstrate and offer a sound,\\n  valid, effective, and innovative audit methodology that reflects\\n  an understanding of the statement of work. \"Valid\" entails\\n  the use of techniques that are known to be feasible with respect\\n  to the area addressed; \"Effective\" refers to the workability\\n  and appropriateness of the methodology. \"Innovative\" means\\n  the development and application of a novel, yet valid technique\\n  that will increase the effectiveness of the approach. Higher\\n  scores will be assigned to offerors who demonstrate sound and\\n  effective internal quality control procedures. Professional\\n  Qualifications (10 points). The offeror must describe in its\\n  proposal: 1) the professional qualifications of the staff that\\n  will be assigned to this contract and 2) demonstrate that it\\n  has sufficient resources to perform the audit and qualified\\n  staff to perform critical tasks necessary to support the audit.\\n  The written response must also include the following information\\n  for all staff participating on the audit: Labor Category (i.e.,\\n  Partner, Manager, etc.); CPA certification date (if applicable);\\n  Other applicable certification(s); Total years of audit and/or\\n  other experience; Advance degree(s) obtained; and Total years\\n  employed by the offeror.

In particular, higher scores will be\\n  given to those who offer recent experience with independent\\n  system operator tariffs, market operations and services, transmission\\n  issues, and bulk power markets like those operated by the CAISO.\\n  Addendum to FAR 52.212-2 SUBPARAGRAPH (a). Technical and past\\n  performance, when combined, are more important than price.\\n  However, award shall be made to the offeror whose proposal\\n  is determined to best meet the needs of the Government after\\n  consideration of all factors i.e., provides the \"best value.\"\\n  \"Best value,\" for the purpose of the contract is defined as\\n  the procurement process that results in the most advantageous\\n  acquisition decision for the Government and is performed through\\n  an integrated assessment and trade-off analysis between technical\\n  and price factors.

The CFTC has made this recommendation in the past and the=20\\nExchange has committed to respond to it. The COMEX Division one-minute trad=\\ne=20\\ntime statistics already include spreads.\\n\\nNYMEX Division Members should note that intra-commodity spread trades will =\\nbe=20\\nincorporated into pit card one-minute trade time accuracy rates after a=20\\n=01&amp;phase in=018 process of approximately 90 days.  In order to avoid subst=\\nandard=20\\npercentages once spreads are incorporated, members must make sure that thei=\\nr=20\\nspread prints are price reported in order to ensure that the Price Change=\\n=20\\nRegister for spreads is accurate.  If a spread print is not reported, you=\\n=20\\nwill not be credited with timely submission of pit cards, even if you throw=\\n=20\\nthe trade into the pit in a timely manner.\\n\\nPit card statistics for outright trades are presently posted on the NYMEX=\\n=20\\nfloor on a weekly basis.  Compliance Staff will continue to post statistics=\\n=20\\nfor outright trades and will additionally post the statistics for spread=20\\ntrades.  These spread trade statistics are for information only so that you=\\n=20\\ncan assess your pit card submission rate in advance of incorporation of=20\\nspreads in the one-minute trade time submission percentages.  For informati=\\non=20\\npurposes, the seller of the spread is considered to be the party who sells=\\n=20\\nthe premium month.

A member who has been problem-free for 3 months woul=\\nd=20\\nbenefit by =01&amp;doing over=018 a fourth (and possibly a fifth) failing month=\\n, thus=20\\nhaving the opportunity to return to the warning letter stage despite=20\\nintervening failing months.  A member who falls below 70% before achieving=\\n=20\\nfour problem-free months will receive a fine or a warning letter, as=20\\nappropriate.  The member can still use a second =01&amp;do over=018 month as lo=\\nng as he=20\\nmeets all the above criteria.\\n\\n_ Staff will follow up with members attending the classes.  Members will=20\\nreceive a breakdown of their most recent audit trail fine.  They will also =\\nbe=20\\ninvited to discuss their percentages with staff on an individual basis. =20\\nFurther, staff will supply daily or weekly statistics to any member by e-ma=\\nil=20\\nor telephone upon request.\\n\\n_ Members are eligible for only one class per year.  A member must take a=\\n=20\\nclass to take advantage of the benefits listed herein.  Classes will be=20\\noffered on June 14, July 10 and August 15, 2001, and the program will apply=\\n=20\\nto the next full month of audit trail statistics.  The Compliance Review=20\\nCommittee and the Floor Committee will evaluate the results of this program=\\n=20\\nbefore deciding whether to extend this program into 2002.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIncorporation of Spreads into One-Minute\\nTrade Time =01&amp;Pit Card=018 Statistics for NYMEX Division\\n\\nPresent one-minute trade time =01&amp;pit card=018 statistics do not include sp=\\nread=20\\ntimes.  During the most recent NYMEX Rule Enforcement Review--the CFTC audi=\\nt=20\\nof the Exchange=01,s Compliance programs and procedures--the CFTC recommend=\\ned=20\\nthat the NYMEX Division incorporate spread trades into the one-minute time=\\n=20\\nstatistics.  The CFTC has made this recommendation in the past and the=20\\nExchange has committed to respond to it. The COMEX Division one-minute trad=\\ne=20\\ntime statistics already include spreads.\\n\\nNYMEX Division Members should note that intra-commodity spread trades will =\\nbe=20\\nincorporated into pit card one-minute trade time accuracy rates after a=20\\n=01&amp;phase in=018 process of approximately 90 days.  In order to avoid subst=\\nandard=20\\npercentages once spreads are incorporated, members must make sure that thei=\\nr=20\\nspread prints are price reported in order to ensure that the Price Change=\\n=20\\nRegister for spreads is accurate.  If a spread print is not reported, you=\\n=20\\nwill not be credited with timely submission of pit cards, even if you throw=\\n=20\\nthe trade into the pit in a timely manner.\\n\\nPit card statistics for outright trades are presently posted on the NYMEX=\\n=20\\nfloor on a weekly basis.  Compliance Staff will continue to post statistics=\\n=20\\nfor outright trades and will additionally post the statistics for spread=20\\ntrades.  These spread trade statistics are for information only so that you=\\n=20\\ncan assess your pit card submission rate in advance of incorporation of=20\\nspreads in the one-minute trade time submission percentages.  For informati=\\non=20\\npurposes, the seller of the spread is considered to be the party who sells=\\n=20\\nthe premium month.  In the case where the spread trades flat, the seller is=\\n=20\\nthe party who sells the nearby month.\\n\\nIf you have any questions about this information, please call Nancy Minett,=\\n=20\\nCompliance Counsel, at (212) 299-2940, or Thomas LaSala, Vice President=20\\nCompliance, at (212) 299-2897.\\n\\n\\n\\n__________________________________________________\\nPlease click on the link below to indicate you have received this\\nemail.\\n\\n\"http://208.206.41.61/email/email_log.cfm?useremail=3Dsara.shackleton@enron=\\n.com&amp;\\nrefdoc=3D(01-190)\"\\n\\nNote: If you click on the above line and nothing happens, please copy\\nthe text between the quotes, open your internet browser,\\npaste it into the web site address and press Return.\\n</td>\n",

earlier email, the Company is under an obligation to retain=\\n, among other documents identified in the Bankruptcy Court's February 15, 2=\\n002 Order, a copy of which you all have received by email, all documents th=\\nat relate to a pending or threatened investigation or lawsuit. As I am sure=\\n you are aware from reading the newspapers and watching television, because=\\n of the number of investigations and lawsuits the universe of relevant docu=\\nments in just this one category covered by the Order is very large. You mus=\\nt retain all relevant company-related documents until these actual or threa=\\ntened lawsuits and investigations are over. No one can then second-guess wh=\\nether you destroyed a relevant document. However, many of you have requeste=\\nd guidance on what must be retained in this category of documents.

The text of the audit solicitation follows the bullets.

Ray\\n\\nAudit description-  FERC seeks to take all appropriate steps for prospective improvements in California markets; accordingly, an independent operational audit of the CAISO will be performed to determine any areas in which the CAISO could enhance its effectiveness in fulfilling its responsibilities in operating the transmission system under its control and administering real-time energy markets.\\n\\nScope- Provide a comparison of the CAISO's actual operations and its FERC tariff and determine whether the CAISO's operations are adequately transparent to market participants.\\n\\nAudit period- 10/1/00-10/1/01\\n\\nDeliverables timing- Draft report due on January 9, 2002; final report due January 16, 2002.\\n\\nAudit schedule-  Begins on November 1, 2001, and ends no later than January 4, 2002.\\n\\nPre-proposal conference- A conference is scheduled for prospective offerors at FERC next Tuesday; FERC will give a brief explanation of the requirements and clarify any questions asked.   \\n\\n\\n\\nPART: U.S. GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENTS\\nSUBPART: SERVICES\\nCLASSCOD: R--Professional, Administrative and Management Support\\n  Services\\nOFFADD: Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), 888 First\\n  Street, NE, Washington, DC 20426\\nSUBJECT: R--OPERATIONAL AUDIT OF CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEM\\n  OPERATIOR. INC. CAISO\\nSOL FERC02RMT22071\\nDUE 102601\\nPOC Charlotte Handley, 202-219-1156 or Andrew Sakallaris,202-219-1150\\nDESC: This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial\\n  items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6,\\n  as supplemented with additional information included in this\\n  notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation;\\n  proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will\\n  not be issued.

Statement of Work: I. BACKGROUND. The California electricity\\n  market has experienced great stress from Summer 2000 to Summer\\n  2001, with demand outstripping supply, wholesale prices rising\\n  dramatically, and key market participants becoming financially\\n  unstable. As a result, the California Independent System Operator,\\n  Inc. (CAISO), which operates the electricity transmission grid\\n  throughout most of California, was forced to adapt to rapidly\\n  changing circumstances. During all of this, the CAISO worked\\n  hard to ensure system reliability. Under the Federal Energy\\n  Regulatory Commission's market mitigation plan, wholesale prices\\n  stabilized in California in Summer 2001. The Commission seeks\\n  to take all appropriate steps for prospective improvements\\n  in California markets, including improvements to help the CAISO\\n  in effectively performing its increasing responsibilities.\\n  Accordingly, an independent operational audit of the CAISO\\n  will be performed to determine the areas, if any, in which\\n  the CAISO could enhance its effectiveness in fulfilling its\\n  responsibilities in operating the transmission system under\\n  its control and administering certain real-time energy markets.\\n  II. SCOPE OF WORK. The Independent Public Accounting (Contractor)\\n  firm shall perform an operational audit of the CAISO processes,\\n  practices, and procedures in accordance with Generally Accepted\\n  Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS). The Contractor shall\\n  provide a comparison of the CAISO's actual operations and its\\n  Commission tariff (procedures and tariff can be found at www.caiso.com).\\n  The Contractor shall ascertain whether the CAISO's operations\\n  are adequately transparent to market participants. To the extent\\n  possible, the Contractor shall also ascertain whether the CAISO's\\n  procedures and operations are consistent with the most effective\\n  business practice. III. AUDIT PERIOD. The audit of the CAISO\\n  shall cover the period commencing October 1, 2000, through\\n  October 1, 2001. IV. DELIVERABLES. The contractor must provide\\n  the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) with a draft\\n  and final report detailing the findings, operating deficiencies\\n  and/or major observations and recommendations. These reports\\n  and other deliverables must be provided to the COR by the close\\n  of business on the following dates: 1) Draft Report - January\\n  9, 2002 2) Final Report - January 16, 2002. V. SCHEDULE. The\\n  operational audit will commence on November 1, 2001, and it\\n  must be completed no later than January 4, 2002. The contractor\\n  shall meet with the COR to discuss the audit no later than\\n  November 6, 2001. The contractor must provide the Commission\\n  with an operational audit plan no later than November 14, 2001.\\n  A detailed operational audit plan will be submitted to the\\n  COR for review, feedback, and approval. The COR or designated\\n  representative will review the plan. VI. Working Papers. The\\n  contractor shall prepare and provide a copy of work papers\\n  in accordance with GAGAS. All work papers shall include the\\n  purpose, sources of information, the procedures performed,\\n  results thereof, and conclusions as appropriate for the planning,\\n  internal control, compliance, and substantive testing phases.\\n  For all findings, work papers shall clearly show the condition\\n  or problem, criteria, cause, effect, and recommendation for\\n  improvement. All working papers shall be cross-referenced to\\n  audit programs, summaries, and final audit report. These documents\\n  will become the property of the Commission. During the course\\n  of the audit or upon completion of the audit work, the Contractor's\\n  audit report and work papers shall be subject to access and\\n  review by the Commission.

Higher scores will be assigned\\n  for contracts that are at least similar in size and complexity.\\n  FERC may obtain and evaluate information from sources other\\n  than those provided by the offeror. FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv) states\\n  \"In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past\\n  performance or for whom information on past performance is\\n  not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or\\n  unfavorably on past performance.\" For the purposes of this\\n  evaluation not being evaluated favorably or unfavorably means\\n  the offeror will receive a rating of \"good or acceptable\" on\\n  company past performance. To obtain a copy of the past performance\\n  form to be completed by the Offeror's references, request from\\n  A. Sakallaris by email. The Offeror will be responsible and\\n  ensure that the references submit or reply by e-mail their\\n  completed response to C.

                                     Here are issues which I'm unclear about, all of which impact the drafting of \\nthe agreement:\\n\\n\\nHow are we setting the heat rate?  Do we have the GADS (?)?  Is it a daily \\naverage, weekly average?  Flat rate? Adjusted? If so, how often?\\n\\nAre we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions?\\n\\nWe have determined that we won't deal with fuel oil, right?\\n\\nWe aren't making money on gas, right?\\n\\nDo we have a defn of costs that we like yet, and if so, how does it fit in to \\nthe picture?\\n\\nIs there an up-to-date set of exhibits?  \\n\\nIt would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the \\nfollowing, in words and/or formulae:\\n\\nThe defn and method of establishing the bogey (target production cost) \\nformula can be an exhibit, which would be great for the commercial team to \\nwork on.   Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost \\nof power)?  How are we setting the bogey?  Formula?  Subject to audit? Two \\nbogeys or one (gas and oil)?\\n\\nWhat is defn of profit?  I think I have the general idea, but a sentence or \\ntwo would be helpful as a reality check.  What costs are included on the buy \\nand sell side?\\n\\nRe stack model: a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used.\\n\\nUpdated exhibit on facilities, contracted resources, operating limits.\\n\\nWhat information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split \\ncosts/profits?  Are we clear that Cities buy gas, MDEA buys/sells power?\\n\\nIt would be great if I could get one set of answers to these \\nquestions/issues, which has commercial buy in all around.\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nKay   \n",

                                     Here are issues which I'm unclear about, all of which impact the drafting of \\nthe agreement:\\n\\n\\nHow are we setting the heat rate?  Do we have the GADS (?)?  Is it a daily \\naverage, weekly average?  Flat rate? Adjusted? If so, how often?\\n\\nAre we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions?\\n\\nWe have determined that we won't deal with fuel oil, right?\\n\\nWe aren't making money on gas, right?\\n\\nDo we have a defn of costs that we like yet, and if so, how does it fit in to \\nthe picture?\\n\\nIs there an up-to-date set of exhibits?  \\n\\nIt would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the \\nfollowing, in words and/or formulae:\\n\\nThe defn and method of establishing the bogey (target production cost) \\nformula can be an exhibit, which would be great for the commercial team to \\nwork on.   Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost \\nof power)?  How are we setting the bogey?  Formula?  Subject to audit? Two \\nbogeys or one (gas and oil)?\\n\\nWhat is defn of profit?  I think I have the general idea, but a sentence or \\ntwo would be helpful as a reality check.  What costs are included on the buy \\nand sell side?\\n\\nRe stack model: a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used.\\n\\nUpdated exhibit on facilities, contracted resources, operating limits.\\n\\nWhat information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split \\ncosts/profits?  Are we clear that Cities buy gas, MDEA buys/sells power?\\n\\nIt would be great if I could get one set of answers to these \\nquestions/issues, which has commercial buy in all around.\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nKay   \n",

Do we have the GADS (?)?  Is it a daily \\naverage, weekly average?  Flat rate? Adjusted? If so, how often?\\n\\nAre we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions?\\n\\nWe have determined that we won't deal with fuel oil, right?\\n\\nWe aren't making money on gas, right?\\n\\nDo we have a defn of costs that we like yet, and if so, how does it fit in to \\nthe picture?\\n\\nIs there an up-to-date set of exhibits?  \\n\\nIt would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the \\nfollowing, in words and/or formulae:\\n\\nThe defn and method of establishing the bogey (target production cost) \\nformula can be an exhibit, which would be great for the commercial team to \\nwork on.   Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost \\nof power)?  How are we setting the bogey?  Formula?  Subject to audit? Two \\nbogeys or one (gas and oil)?\\n\\nWhat is defn of profit?  I think I have the general idea, but a sentence or \\ntwo would be helpful as a reality check.  What costs are included on the buy \\nand sell side?\\n\\nRe stack model: a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used.\\n\\nUpdated exhibit on facilities, contracted resources, operating limits.\\n\\nWhat information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split \\ncosts/profits?

Do we have the GADS (?)?  Is it a daily \\naverage, weekly average?  Flat rate? Adjusted? If so, how often?\\n\\nAre we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions?\\n\\nWe have determined that we won't deal with fuel oil, right?\\n\\nWe aren't making money on gas, right?\\n\\nDo we have a defn of costs that we like yet, and if so, how does it fit in to \\nthe picture?\\n\\nIs there an up-to-date set of exhibits?  \\n\\nIt would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the \\nfollowing, in words and/or formulae:\\n\\nThe defn and method of establishing the bogey (target production cost) \\nformula can be an exhibit, which would be great for the commercial team to \\nwork on.   Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost \\nof power)?  How are we setting the bogey?  Formula?  Subject to audit? Two \\nbogeys or one (gas and oil)?\\n\\nWhat is defn of profit?  I think I have the general idea, but a sentence or \\ntwo would be helpful as a reality check.  What costs are included on the buy \\nand sell side?\\n\\nRe stack model: a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used.\\n\\nUpdated exhibit on facilities, contracted resources, operating limits.\\n\\nWhat information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split \\ncosts/profits?  Are we clear that Cities buy gas, MDEA buys/sells power?\\n\\nIt would be great if I could get one set of answers to these \\nquestions/issues, which has commercial buy in all around.\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nKay\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \n",

The monthly fee should be $13,003.  I took the $300k we have all been discussing and backed out the $12,500 they paid under the ILA terms.\\n\\n \\n\\nReagan C.

Do we have the GADS (?)?  Is it a daily average, weekly average?  Flat rate? Adjusted? If so, how often?\\n\\nAre we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions?\\n\\nWe have determined that we won't deal with fuel oil, right?\\n\\nWe aren't making money on gas, right?\\n\\nDo we have a defn of costs that we like yet, and if so, how does it fit in to the picture?\\n\\nIs there an up-to-date set of exhibits?  \\n\\nIt would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the following, in words and/or formulae:\\n\\nThe defn and method of establishing the bogey (target production cost) formula can be an exhibit, which would be great for the commercial team to work on.   Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost of power)?  How are we setting the bogey?  Formula?  Subject to audit? Two bogeys or one (gas and oil)?\\n\\nWhat is defn of profit?  I think I have the general idea, but a sentence or two would be helpful as a reality check.  What costs are included on the buy and sell side?\\n\\nRe stack model: a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used.\\n\\nUpdated exhibit on facilities, contracted resources, operating limits.\\n\\nWhat information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split costs/profits?  Are we clear that Cities buy gas, MDEA buys/sells power?\\n\\nIt would be great if I could get one set of answers to these questions/issues, which has commercial buy in all around.\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nKay\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<Embedded Picture (Device Independent Bitmap)>   \n",

Submission for NYMEX\\n\\n\\nModification of =01&Clear-out Period=018\\n\\nThe Board of Directors has approved modifications to the fine structure for=\\n=20\\none-minute trade time submission for both NYMEX and COMEX divisions.=20\\nPresently members falling below 80% timely submission per month are issued=\\n=20\\nescalating warning letters and fines unless and until they clear out

After six months=\\n,=20\\nthe member returns to a =01&warning letter=018 level.  Effective immediatel=\\ny, this=20\\n=01&clear-out period=018 is reduced from six months to four months.  One-mi=\\nnute=20\\ntrade timing statistics for the month ending April 30, 2001 will reflect th=\\nis=20\\nmodification.\\n\\n\\nImplementation of One-Minute Trade-Time Classes\\n\\nThe Board also accepted the recommendation of the Compliance Review Committ=\\nee=20\\nand Floor Committee to adopt a training program for members facing one-minu=\\nte=20\\ntrade time fines on the NYMEX division.  The purpose of the program is to=\\n=20\\nimprove Exchange trade submission timing through member education by=20\\nidentifying individual issues, tailoring individual solutions and statistic=\\nal=20\\nfollow-up.  Training will be conducted at dates to be announced during June=\\n,=20\\nJuly and August 2001 by a team comprised of Committee Members and Complianc=\\ne=20\\nStaff with the assistance of the Training and Education Committee.\\n\\nAs incentive, any member attending the class will be allowed to =01&do over=\\n=018 up=20\\nto two subsequent months in which their trade time rates are between 70% an=\\nd=20\\n79%.

The class will be an intensive discussion of pit card problems=\\n=20\\nand pitfalls.  Materials will focus on how the audit trail works and=20\\nsuccessful strategies for achieving a passing grade.  Members attending cla=\\nss=20\\nwill be required to analyze their own trading style in light of the materia=\\nl=20\\npresented and pinpoint areas which they need to improve.  Members will also=\\n=20\\nbe required to outline a plan of attack to address raising their pit card=\\n=20\\nperformance rates.

Members attending classes are=20\\nstrongly encouraged to bring their clerks with them!\\n Upon completion of the class, members will be allowed to =01&do over=018 u=\\np to two=20\\nsubsequent months in which they received the warning or fine for substandar=\\nd=20\\ntrade time rates between 70% and 79%, on their way to achieving four months=\\n=20\\nclear.  No fine or warning letter will be issued for a =01&do over=018 mont=\\nh but=20\\nthe month will not count as a passing month.  A member who falls below 70%=\\n=20\\nwill receive a fine or warning letter.\\n The benefit to the member will be that the month that would have counted a=\\ns=20\\na failing month will not count at all, as long as the member achieved at=20\\nleast a 70% rate.  Members still need four problem free months to return to=\\n a=20\\nwarning letter stage from a fine stage.  A member who has been problem free=\\n=20\\nfor 3 months would benefit by =01&doing over=018 a fourth (and possibly a f=\\nifth)=20\\nfailing month, thus having the opportunity to return to a warning letter=20\\nphase despite intervening failing months.  A member who falls below 70%=20\\nbefore achieving four problem free months will receive a fine or a warning=\\n=20\\nletter, as appropriate.  The member can still use a second =01&do over=018 =\\nmonth as=20\\nlong as he meets all criteria.\\n Staff will follow up with members attending the classes.  Members will=20\\nreceive a breakdown of their most recent audit trail fine.  They will also =\\nbe=20\\ninvited to discuss their percentages with staff one-on-one.  Further, staff=\\n=20\\nwill supply daily or weekly statistics to any member by e-mail upon request=\\n.\\n Members are eligible for only one class per year.  A member must take a=20\\nclass before being given the benefits listed herein.  Classes will be offer=\\ned=20\\nin the third week of the months listed, at a date to be announced, and the=\\n=20\\nprogram will apply to the next full month of audit trail results.  The=20\\nCompliance Review Committee and the Floor Committee will evaluate the resul=\\nts=20\\nof this program before deciding whether to extend this program into 2002.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIncorporation of Spreads into One-Minute\\nTrade Time =01&Pit Card=018 Statistics for NYMEX Division\\n\\nPresent one-minute trade time =01&pit card=018 statistics do not include sp=\\nread=20\\ntimes.  During the most recent NYMEX Rule Enforcement Review--the CFTC audi=\\nt=20\\nof the Exchange=01,s Compliance programs and procedures--the CFTC recommend=\\ned=20\\nthat the NYMEX Division incorporate spread trades into the one-minute time=\\n=20\\nstatistics.  The CFTC has made this recommendation in the past and the=20\\nExchange has committed to respond to it. The COMEX Division one-minute trad=\\ne=20\\ntime statistics already include spreads.\\n\\nNYMEX Division Members should note that intra-commodity spread trades will =\\nbe=20\\nincorporated into pit card one-minute trade time accuracy rates after a=20\\n=01&phase in=018 process of approximately 90 days.  In order to avoid subst=\\nandard=20\\npercentages once spreads are incorporated, members must make sure that thei=\\nr=20\\nspread prints are price reported in order to ensure that the Price Change=\\n=20\\nRegister for spreads is accurate.  If a spread print is not reported, you=\\n=20\\nwill not be credited with timely submission of pit cards, even if you throw=\\n=20\\nthe trade into the pit in a timely manner.\\n\\nPit card statistics for outright trades are presently posted on the NYMEX=\\n=20\\nfloor on a weekly basis.  Compliance Staff will continue to post statistics=\\n=20\\nfor outright trades and will additionally post the statistics for spread=20\\ntrades.  These spread trade statistics are for information only so that you=\\n=20\\ncan assess your pit card submission rate in advance of incorporation of=20\\nspreads in the one-minute trade time submission percentages.  For informati=\\non=20\\npurposes, the seller of the spread is considered to be the party who sells=\\n=20\\nthe premium month.  In the case where the spread trades flat, the seller is=\\n=20\\nthe party who sells the nearby month.\\n\\nIf you have any questions about this information, please call Nancy Minett,=\\n=20\\nCompliance Counsel, at (212) 299-2940, or Thomas LaSala, Vice President=20\\nCompliance, at (212) 299-2897.\\n\\n\\n\\n__________________________________________________\\nPlease click on the link below to indicate you have received this\\nemail.\\n\\n\"http://208.206.41.61/email/email_log.cfm?useremail=3Dsara.shackleton@enron=\\n.com&\\nrefdoc=3D(01-167)\"\\n\\nNote: If you click on the above line and nothing happens, please copy\\nthe text between the quotes, open your internet browser,\\npaste it into the web site address and press Return.\\n   \n",

NOTICE\\n\\nTo:\\nAll NYMEX Division Members\\nAll COMEX Division Members\\n\\nFrom:\\nNeal Wolkoff, Executive Vice President\\n\\nRe:\\nChanges to Audit Trail Summary Fine Structure-NYMEX & COMEX Divisions\\n\\n\\nModification of =01&Clear-out Period=018\\n\\nThe Board of Directors has approved modifications to the fine structure for=\\n=20\\none-minute trade time submission for both NYMEX and COMEX Divisions. =20\\nPresently members falling below the 80% timely submission standard are issu=\\ned=20\\nescalating warning letters and fines unless and until they clear out their=\\n=20\\nrecord by being in compliance for six consecutive months.  After six months=\\n,=20\\nthe member returns to a =01&warning letter=018 level.  Effective immediatel=\\ny, this=20\\n=01&clear-out period=018 is reduced from six months to four months.  One-mi=\\nnute=20\\ntrade timing statistics for the month ending April 30, 2001 will reflect th=\\nis=20\\nmodification.\\n\\n\\nImplementation of One-Minute Trade-Time Classes\\n\\nThe Board also accepted the recommendation of the Compliance Review Committ=\\nee=20\\nand Floor Committee to adopt a training program for members facing one-minu=\\nte=20\\ntrade time fines on the NYMEX Division.  The purpose of the program is to=\\n=20\\nimprove Exchange trade submission timing through member education by=20\\nidentifying individual issues, tailoring individual solutions and statistic=\\nal=20\\nfollow-up.  Training will be conducted on Thursday, June 14, Tuesday, July=\\n=20\\n10, and Wednesday, August 15, 2001 by a team comprised of Committee Members=\\n=20\\nand Compliance Staff with the assistance of the Training and Education=20\\nCommittee.  You may sign up for these classes at the Corrections Windows on=\\n=20\\nthe 3rd and 5th floors, or by contacting Lois S. Shapiro, Associate=20\\nCompliance Counsel, at (212) 299-2853.  The June 14, 2001 class will be hel=\\nd=20\\nin the Seminar Room on the 10th floor at 3:45 p.m.  Plan to stay until 6:00=\\n=20\\np.m.  Credit will not be given to anyone who does not attend the entire cla=\\nss.\\n\\nAs incentive, any member attending any one class will be allowed to =01&do =\\nover=018=20\\nup to two subsequent months in which their trade time rates are between 70%=\\n=20\\nand 79%.  The member will still have to complete four violation-free months=\\n=20\\nbefore his record is =01&cleared out=018 but he may take up to six months t=\\no do=20\\nso.  Members may take one class per year.\\n\\nAudit Trail Classes\\n\\n? Purpose:   to improve pit card submission statistics Exchange-wide by=20\\nreducing the number of individual members falling below the 80% standard fo=\\nr=20\\ntimely pit card submission and to facilitate their return to a =01&warning=\\n=20\\nletter=018 level.\\n\\n? Members who have received a warning letter or a fine for pit card=20\\nviolations may:\\n\\n_ Attend an audit trail class, to be offered on June 14, July10, and August=\\n=20\\n15, 2001, with future dates to be determined by the Floor=20\\nCommittee/Compliance Review Committee.  The class will be an intensive=20\\ndiscussion of pit card problems and pitfalls.  Materials will focus on how=\\n=20\\nthe audit trail works and successful strategies for achieving a passing=20\\npercentage.  Members will be required to analyze their own trading style in=\\n=20\\nlight of the material presented and pinpoint areas in which they need to=20\\nimprove.  Members will also be required to outline a plan for raising their=\\n=20\\npit card performance rates.  Each plan will be discussed with the group and=\\n=20\\nmembers will receive feedback from Floor Committee and Compliance Review=20\\nCommittee Members, and Compliance and Floor Department Staff.  Members=20\\nattending classes are strongly encouraged to bring their clerks with them!\\n\\n_ Upon completion of the class, members will be allowed to =01&do over=018 =\\nup to=20\\ntwo subse-quent months in which their timely submission rates fall between=\\n=20\\n70% and 79%.  No fine or warning letter will be issued for a =01&do over=01=\\n8 month,=20\\nbut the month will not count as a passing month.  A member who falls below=\\n=20\\n70% will receive a fine or warning letter.\\n\\n_ The benefit to the member will be that the month that would have counted =\\nas=20\\na failing month will not count at all, as long as the member achieved at=20\\nleast a 70% rate.  Members still need four problem-free months to return to=\\n a=20\\nwarning letter stage.  A member who has been problem-free for 3 months woul=\\nd=20\\nbenefit by =01&doing over=018 a fourth (and possibly a fifth) failing month=\\n, thus=20\\nhaving the opportunity to return to the warning letter stage despite=20\\nintervening failing months.  A member who falls below 70% before achieving=\\n=20\\nfour problem-free months will receive a fine or a warning letter, as=20\\nappropriate.  The member can still use a second =01&do over=018 month as lo=\\nng as he=20\\nmeets all the above criteria.\\n\\n_ Staff will follow up with members attending the classes.  Members will=20\\nreceive a breakdown of their most recent audit trail fine.  They will also =\\nbe=20\\ninvited to discuss their percentages with staff on an individual basis. =20\\nFurther, staff will supply daily or weekly statistics to any member by e-ma=\\nil=20\\nor telephone upon request.\\n\\n_ Members are eligible for only one class per year.  A member must take a=\\n=20\\nclass to take advantage of the benefits listed herein.  Classes will be=20\\noffered on June 14, July 10 and August 15, 2001, and the program will apply=\\n=20\\nto the next full month of audit trail statistics.  The Compliance Review=20\\nCommittee and the Floor Committee will evaluate the results of this program=\\n=20\\nbefore deciding whether to extend this program into 2002.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIncorporation of Spreads into One-Minute\\nTrade Time =01&Pit Card=018 Statistics for NYMEX Division\\n\\nPresent one-minute trade time =01&pit card=018 statistics do not include sp=\\nread=20\\ntimes.  During the most recent NYMEX Rule Enforcement Review--the CFTC audi=\\nt=20\\nof the Exchange=01,s Compliance programs and procedures--the CFTC recommend=\\ned=20\\nthat the NYMEX Division incorporate spread trades into the one-minute time=\\n=20\\nstatistics.  The CFTC has made this recommendation in the past and the=20\\nExchange has committed to respond to it. The COMEX Division one-minute trad=\\ne=20\\ntime statistics already include spreads.\\n\\nNYMEX Division Members should note that intra-commodity spread trades will =\\nbe=20\\nincorporated into pit card one-minute trade time accuracy rates after a=20\\n=01&phase in=018 process of approximately 90 days.  In order to avoid subst=\\nandard=20\\npercentages once spreads are incorporated, members must make sure that thei=\\nr=20\\nspread prints are price reported in order to ensure that the Price Change=\\n=20\\nRegister for spreads is accurate.  If a spread print is not reported, you=\\n=20\\nwill not be credited with timely submission of pit cards, even if you throw=\\n=20\\nthe trade into the pit in a timely manner.\\n\\nPit card statistics for outright trades are presently posted on the NYMEX=\\n=20\\nfloor on a weekly basis.  Compliance Staff will continue to post statistics=\\n=20\\nfor outright trades and will additionally post the statistics for spread=20\\ntrades.  These spread trade statistics are for information only so that you=\\n=20\\ncan assess your pit card submission rate in advance of incorporation of=20\\nspreads in the one-minute trade time submission percentages.  For informati=\\non=20\\npurposes, the seller of the spread is considered to be the party who sells=\\n=20\\nthe premium month.  In the case where the spread trades flat, the seller is=\\n=20\\nthe party who sells the nearby month.\\n\\nIf you have any questions about this information, please call Nancy Minett,=\\n=20\\nCompliance Counsel, at (212) 299-2940, or Thomas LaSala, Vice President=20\\nCompliance, at (212) 299-2897.\\n\\n\\n\\n__________________________________________________\\nPlease click on the link below to indicate you have received this\\nemail.\\n\\n\"http://208.206.41.61/email/email_log.cfm?useremail=3Dsara.shackleton@enron=\\n.com&\\nrefdoc=3D(01-190)\"\\n\\nNote: If you click on the above line and nothing happens, please copy\\nthe text between the quotes, open your internet browser,\\npaste it into the web site address and press Return.\\n   \n",

I am on vacation next week, so \\nhere are my current thoughts.  I am contactable on my mobile if necessary.\\n\\nGas to power correlations\\n I see your point about gas to power correlation only affecting VAR for the \\ncombined gas and power portfolio, and this raises an interesting point:  At a \\nconservative 30% long term correlation, combined VAR is o1mm less than \\npreviously expected - so how does this affect the limit breach?  Strictly \\nspeaking, we are still over our UK power limit, but the limit was set when we \\nwere assuming no gas power correlation and therefore a higher portfolio VAR.  \\n\\nA suggested way forward given the importance of the spread options to the UK \\nGas and Power books- \\ncan we allocate to the gas and power books a share of the reduction in \\nportfolio VAR  - ie [Reduction = Portfolio VAR - sum(Power VAR + Gas VAR)]?\\n\\nAlso, if I understand your mail correctly, Matrix 1 implies 55% gas power \\ncorrelation is consistent with our correlation curves, and this reduces total \\nVAR by o1.8mm.\\n\\nEFA slot correlations\\nThe issue of whether our existing EFA to EFA correlation matrix is correct is \\na separate issue.  I don't understand where the Matrix 2 EFA to EFA \\ncorrelations come from, but I am happy for you to run some historical \\ncorrelations from the forward curves (use the first 2 years, I would \\nsuggest).  Our original matrix was based on historicals, but the analysis is \\nworth doing again.  Your matrix 2 results certainly indicate how important \\nthese correlations are.\\n\\nClosing thoughts\\nFriday's trading left us longer so I would not expect a limit breach on \\nMonday.  We are still reviewing the shape of the long term curve, and I'd \\nlike to wait until both Simon Hastings and I are back in the office (Monday \\nweek) before finalising this.\\n \\nRegards\\n\\nRichard\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nTanya Tamarchenko\\n06/10/2000 22:59\\nTo: Oliver Gaylard/LON/ECT@ECT, Richard Lewis/LON/ECT@ECT, James \\nNew/LON/ECT@ECT, Steven Leppard/LON/ECT@ECT, Rudy Dautel/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kirstee \\nHewitt/LON/ECT@ECT, Naveen Andrews/Corp/Enron@ENRON, David Port/Market \\nRisk/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT\\ncc:  \\n\\nSubject: Re: VaR correlation scenarios  \\n\\nEverybody,\\nOliver  sent us the VAR number for different correlations for UK-Power \\nportfolio separately from UK-Gas portfolio.\\n\\nFirst, if VAR is calculated accurately the correlation between Power and Gas \\ncurves should not affect VAR number for Power and VAR number for Gas, only \\nthe aggregate number will be affected. The changes you see are due to the \\nfact that we use Monte-Carlo simulation method,\\nwhich accuracy depends on the number of simulations. Even if we don't change \\nthe correlations but use different realizations of random numbers,\\nwe get slightly different result from the model.\\n\\nSo: to see the effect of using different correlations between Gas and Power \\nwe should look at the aggregate number.\\n\\nI calculated weighted correlations based on 2 curves I got from Paul. As the \\nweights along the term structure I used the product of price, position and \\nvolatility for each time bucket for Gas and each of EFA slots. The results \\nare shown below:\\n\\n\\nInserting these numbers into the original correlation matrix produced \\nnegatively definite correlation matrix, which brakes VAR engine. \\nCorrelation matrix for any set of random variables is non-negative by \\ndefinition, and remains non-negatively definite if calculated properly based \\non any historical data.\\nHere, according to our phone discussion, we started experimenting with \\ncorrelations, assuming the same correlation for each EFA slot and ET Elec \\nversus Gas. I am sending you the spreadsheet which summaries the results. In \\naddition to the aggregate VAR numbers for the runs Oliver did, you can see \\nthe VAR numbers based on correlation Matrix 1 and Matrix 2. In Matrix 1 the \\ncorrelations across EFA slots are identical to these in original matrix.\\nI obtained this matrix by trial and error. Matrix 2 is produces by Naveen \\nusing Finger's algorithm, it differs from original matrix across EFA slots as \\nwell\\nas in Power versus Gas correlations and gives higher VAR than matrix 1 does. \\n\\nConcluding: we will look at the historical forward prices and try to \\ncalculate historical correlations from them.\\n\\nTanya.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOliver Gaylard\\n10/06/2000 01:50 PM\\nTo: Richard Lewis/LON/ECT@ECT, James New/LON/ECT@ECT, Steven \\nLeppard/LON/ECT@ECT, Rudy Dautel/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kirstee Hewitt/LON/ECT@ECT, \\nNaveen Andrews/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Tanya Tamarchenko/HOU/ECT@ECT, David \\nPort/Market Risk/Corp/Enron@ENRON\\ncc:  \\nSubject: VaR correlation scenarios\\n\\nThe results were as follows when changing the gas/power correlations:\\n\\nCorrelation  VaR-UK Power book       VaR- UK Gas book\\n 0.0  o10.405MM       o3.180MM\\n 0.1  o10.134MM       o3.197MM\\n 0.2  o10.270MM       o3.185MM\\n 0.3  o10.030MM       o3.245MM\\n 0.4  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)\\n 0.5  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)\\n 0.6  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)\\n 0.7  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)\\n 0.8  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)\\n 0.9  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)\\n 1.0  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)\\n \\nPeaks and off peaks were treated the same to avoid violating the matrix's \\nintegrity. \\n\\nInteresting to note that for a higher correlation of 0.2 the power VaR \\nincreases which is counter to intuition.

My schedule melted down after we talked on Monday.  Here's \\nwhere folks came out.  There's some concern about size.  We're supposed to be \\nno larger than 3, but we lobbied Aceves and he apparently Ok'd our \\n\"oversized\" group.  The other folks in the group--who talked to him \\noriginally--are pretty sure that five will violate the rules.  Folks wondered \\nif there were other groups that are smaller than ours that you could hook up \\nwith.  Sorry about that---it's a wrinkle that I didn't think about when we \\nspoke.  If it gets real ugly trying to find a smaller group, let me know.  \\nFortunately there's not another team case due for two weeks.\\n\\nBest,\\nJeff   \n",

I am on vacation next week, so \\nhere are my current thoughts.  I am contactable on my mobile if necessary.\\n\\nGas to power correlations\\n I see your point about gas to power correlation only affecting VAR for the \\ncombined gas and power portfolio, and this raises an interesting point:  At a \\nconservative 30% long term correlation, combined VAR is o1mm less than \\npreviously expected - so how does this affect the limit breach?  Strictly \\nspeaking, we are still over our UK power limit, but the limit was set when we \\nwere assuming no gas power correlation and therefore a higher portfolio VAR.  \\n\\nA suggested way forward given the importance of the spread options to the UK \\nGas and Power books- \\ncan we allocate to the gas and power books a share of the reduction in \\nportfolio VAR  - ie [Reduction = Portfolio VAR - sum(Power VAR + Gas VAR)]?\\n\\nAlso, if I understand your mail correctly, Matrix 1 implies 55% gas power \\ncorrelation is consistent with our correlation curves, and this reduces total \\nVAR by o1.8mm.\\n\\nEFA slot correlations\\nThe issue of whether our existing EFA to EFA correlation matrix is correct is \\na separate issue.  I don't understand where the Matrix 2 EFA to EFA \\ncorrelations come from, but I am happy for you to run some historical \\ncorrelations from the forward curves (use the first 2 years, I would \\nsuggest).  Our original matrix was based on historicals, but the analysis is \\nworth doing again.  Your matrix 2 results certainly indicate how important \\nthese correlations are.\\n\\nClosing thoughts\\nFriday's trading left us longer so I would not expect a limit breach on \\nMonday.  We are still reviewing the shape of the long term curve, and I'd \\nlike to wait until both Simon Hastings and I are back in the office (Monday \\nweek) before finalising this.\\n \\nRegards\\n\\nRichard\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nTanya Tamarchenko\\n06/10/2000 22:59\\nTo: Oliver Gaylard/LON/ECT@ECT, Richard Lewis/LON/ECT@ECT, James \\nNew/LON/ECT@ECT, Steven Leppard/LON/ECT@ECT, Rudy Dautel/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kirstee \\nHewitt/LON/ECT@ECT, Naveen Andrews/Corp/Enron@ENRON, David Port/Market \\nRisk/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT\\ncc:  \\n\\nSubject: Re: VaR correlation scenarios  \\n\\nEverybody,\\nOliver  sent us the VAR number for different correlations for UK-Power \\nportfolio separately from UK-Gas portfolio.\\n\\nFirst, if VAR is calculated accurately the correlation between Power and Gas \\ncurves should not affect VAR number for Power and VAR number for Gas, only \\nthe aggregate number will be affected. The changes you see are due to the \\nfact that we use Monte-Carlo simulation method,\\nwhich accuracy depends on the number of simulations. Even if we don't change \\nthe correlations but use different realizations of random numbers,\\nwe get slightly different result from the model.\\n\\nSo: to see the effect of using different correlations between Gas and Power \\nwe should look at the aggregate number.\\n\\nI calculated weighted correlations based on 2 curves I got from Paul. As the \\nweights along the term structure I used the product of price, position and \\nvolatility for each time bucket for Gas and each of EFA slots. The results \\nare shown below:\\n\\n\\nInserting these numbers into the original correlation matrix produced \\nnegatively definite correlation matrix, which brakes VAR engine. \\nCorrelation matrix for any set of random variables is non-negative by \\ndefinition, and remains non-negatively definite if calculated properly based \\non any historical data.\\nHere, according to our phone discussion, we started experimenting with \\ncorrelations, assuming the same correlation for each EFA slot and ET Elec \\nversus Gas. I am sending you the spreadsheet which summaries the results. In \\naddition to the aggregate VAR numbers for the runs Oliver did, you can see \\nthe VAR numbers based on correlation Matrix 1 and Matrix 2. In Matrix 1 the \\ncorrelations across EFA slots are identical to these in original matrix.\\nI obtained this matrix by trial and error. Matrix 2 is produces by Naveen \\nusing Finger's algorithm, it differs from original matrix across EFA slots as \\nwell\\nas in Power versus Gas correlations and gives higher VAR than matrix 1 does. \\n\\nConcluding: we will look at the historical forward prices and try to \\ncalculate historical correlations from them.\\n\\nTanya.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOliver Gaylard\\n10/06/2000 01:50 PM\\nTo: Richard Lewis/LON/ECT@ECT, James New/LON/ECT@ECT, Steven \\nLeppard/LON/ECT@ECT, Rudy Dautel/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kirstee Hewitt/LON/ECT@ECT, \\nNaveen Andrews/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Tanya Tamarchenko/HOU/ECT@ECT, David \\nPort/Market Risk/Corp/Enron@ENRON\\ncc:  \\nSubject: VaR correlation scenarios\\n\\nThe results were as follows when changing the gas/power correlations:\\n\\nCorrelation  VaR-UK Power book       VaR- UK Gas book\\n 0.0  o10.405MM       o3.180MM\\n 0.1  o10.134MM       o3.197MM\\n 0.2  o10.270MM       o3.185MM\\n 0.3  o10.030MM       o3.245MM\\n 0.4  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)\\n 0.5  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)\\n 0.6  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)\\n 0.7  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)\\n 0.8  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)\\n 0.9  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)\\n 1.0  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)\\n \\nPeaks and off peaks were treated the same to avoid violating the matrix's \\nintegrity. \\n\\nInteresting to note that for a higher correlation of 0.2 the power VaR \\nincreases which is counter to intuition.

Change Order #5--Pleasanton Transformer\\n\\nA redraft of Change Order #5 to the LM 6000 contract to provide for the \\npurchase of a GE transformer for the Pleasanton project is attached.  \\n\\nPlease note that I have added some guaranty/LD provisions in Exhibit A, and \\nconfirm whether these are appropriate in scope and amount.\\n\\nWe will attach the documents included here as separate files as Exhibits B \\nand C.  I understand that GE is to provide a more current copy of their \\nstandard specifications for the transformer to be included in the Exhibits.\\n\\n\\nKathleen:  Kay tells me that you are the keeper of change orders.  \\nCongratulations!!  The discussion of current amount balances, etc. in the \\nattached are clearly wrong if we are up to CO#5--it was all based on this \\nbeing the third CO.  Can you please let me know what the right numbers should \\nbe?\\n\\nThanks in advance for your input.  I understand there is some urgency with \\ngetting this out.\\n\\n\\n   \n",

These\\nprofit-and-loss reports were designed to\\nreflect economic reality. Frequently they\\ndid not. Instead of recording the entire\\nprofit for a trade in one column, some\\ntraders reportedly split the profit from a\\ntrade into two columns. The first column\\nreflected the portion of the actual profits\\nthe trader intended to add to Enron's cur-rent\\nfinancial statements. The second col-umn,\\nironically labeled the 'prudency'\\nreserve, included the remainder.\"\\nPartnoy told the committee that in\\nhis estimation, \"Enron's 'prudency'\\nreserves did not depict economic reality,\\nnor could they have been intended to do\\nso. Instead, 'prudency' was a slush fund\\nthat could be used to smooth out profits\\nand losses over time. The portion of prof-its\\nrecorded as 'prudency' could be used\\nto offset any future losses,\" he said.\\nHe recommended that investigators\\nquestion Enron employees who were\\ninvolved in these transactions \"to get a sense\\nof whether my summaries are complete.\"\\nAlleged Enron abuses of mark-to-market accounting emerge</td>\n",

Based on their previously filed tariff, it appeared that they would not, but it seems they have reconsidered and recently filed a new Attachment M that details how they will handle losses financially.  I have not yet seen the new Attachment M, so it may be a complex or costly process, but hopefully, it will be fine.\\n\\nNow, for the Important Question.  MISO does not believe they will be able to process third-party loss schedules (either INT or EXT, in Tag parlance) on Dec 15.  I don't think this is an issue for us (I expect we will typically be either accounting for losses financially or through in-kind schedules (dropping off losses along the path).\\n\\nIf this is not correct, and we do sometimes schedule in losses under separate transactions, please let me know ASAP.  Also let me know how prevalent that practice is.  MISO is trying to figure out how urgent the need is to accommodate that on Dec 15.  While they don't believe they will be able to meet that deadline, they want to know how many resources they should allocate to addressing the problem.\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nAndy Rodriquez\\nRegulatory Affairs - Enron Corp.\\nandy.rodriquez@enron.com\\n713-345-3771</td>\n",

              "      <td>Legal has been assessing the risks of doing block forward trades as financial \\nand for now, subject to future changes that may be required  as discussions \\nwith the CAPX legal experts continue,  we can state the basic rules as \\nfollows:\\n\\nIt is okay to do up to 50% of  our Block Forward business as financial.\\nIt is very important to monitor this 50% level very closely and we should not \\nexceed it. We should not rely on the PX to tell us what the level is. We \\nshould confirm it ourselves.  A skeptical regulator, looking at PX records \\nshould never be able to see that we ever did more than half our block forward \\nbusiness as financial.  \\nOne of the legal rules that we must comply with in this area is that there \\nmust be a bona fide commercial reason for going financial.  This \\ndumbfoundingly simple sounding rule is important.  Somehow, when we \\ncommunicate our decision to the PX to go from physical to financial, we \\nshould give our reason.  I'm not sure whether our decision is expressed by \\nphone, or electronically, but in either case,  the person making the change \\nwith the PX should get in an expression something like this:  \"we would like \\nto change these trades to financial because we think the elimination of \\nphysical risk will benefit us commercially.\"  Please be patient with this \\nself serving requirement and do it. \\n\\n I have not worked out with any of the other back office groups how this new \\npractice will be handled. Obviously any changes it will require in \\nscheduling, settlements and accounting need to be dealt with too. Please call \\nme with any questions.  ----cgy \\n</td>\n",

All rights reserved.\" WASHINGTO=\\nN -- The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, in one of the first fraud=\\n cases ever filed against a Big Five accounting firm, fined Arthur Andersen=\\n LLP and three partners more than $7-million (U.S.) in connection with audi=\\nts of Waste Management Inc.'s annual financial results.=20\\nIn a complaint filed in U.S. District Court here, the SEC alleged that Arth=\\nur Andersen and its partners allowed Waste Management to continue for sever=\\nal years a series of improper accounting practices that inflated the garbag=\\ne-hauling concern's earnings. The complaint alleges fraud on the part of th=\\nree audit partners assigned to the Waste Management account: Robert Allgyer=\\n, 56 years old, of Lake Forest, Ill., who has retired; Walter Cercavschi, 4=\\n5, of Harwood Heights, Ill.; and Edward Maier, 54, of Chicago.=20\\nArthur Anderson agreed to pay the fine to settle the case, but the firm and=\\n the auditors don't admit or deny the allegations. Among the audit partners=\\n, Mr. Allgyer agreed to pay $50,000, Mr. Maier, $40,000, and Mr. Cercavschi=\\n, $30,000. Arthur Andersen agreed to pay $7-million.  As part of a campaign=\\n to curb what it sees as growing accounting fraud, the SEC has broadened a =\\nnumber of investigations of companies' earnings reports to include audit wo=\\nrk done by outside accountants.  In bringing the first fraud case against a=\\nny audit firm since 1985, SEC enforcement chief Richard Walker said the act=\\nion \"helps to underscore the importance of auditors as gatekeepers to our c=\\napital markets and shows the SEC won't shy away from making auditors comply=\\n with their responsibilities.\"  Under a related administrative proceeding f=\\niled yesterday alleging professional misconduct, the SEC also censured Arth=\\nur Andersen, the three audit partners and a fourth partner, Robert Kutsenda=\\n, who was the regional audit director at the time of the alleged violations=\\n. As part of the censure, the four audit partners are barred from doing acc=\\nounting work for public companies for a period of one to five years.  \"This=\\n settlement allows the firm and its partners to close a very difficult chap=\\nter and move on,\" said Terry Hatchett, Arthur Andersen's managing partner-N=\\north America. \"The SEC has not questioned the underlying quality or effecti=\\nveness of our overall audit methodology, nor has the SEC limited our abilit=\\ny to conduct audits for other public companies.\"  An attorney for Mr. Allgy=\\ner declined to comment. Attorneys for Mr. Maier, Mr. Cercavschi and Mr. Kut=\\nsenda didn't return phone calls.  Waste Management said it \"has co-operated=\\n fully with the SEC in the investigation, and does not believe that the SEC=\\n will seek any action against Waste Management in connection with the event=\\ns detailed in the Arthur Andersen settlement.\"  The Waste Management accoun=\\nting scandal stands out for it size and breadth. After a board-led probe tu=\\nrned up years of questionable accounting, the company took a $3.5-billion c=\\nharge in 1998, and since then the trash hauler and Arthur Andersen agreed t=\\no pay $220-million to settle shareholder litigation in the matter.  The com=\\npany admitted it had overstated its pretax earnings by $1.43-billion in 199=\\n2 to 1996 -- the biggest restatement in SEC history. Neither Waste Manageme=\\nnt nor any of its employees have been disciplined by the SEC. The SEC said =\\nyesterday that the investigation continues.  Within the SEC, the Arthur And=\\nerson investigation became a centrepiece of the commission's aggressive cam=\\npaign to demonstrate that conflicts of interest can be caused by consulting=\\n and other non-auditing services that numerous accounting firms now routine=\\nly offer audit clients. =09\\n</td>\n",

These\\nprofit-and-loss reports were designed to\\nreflect economic reality. Frequently they\\ndid not. Instead of recording the entire\\nprofit for a trade in one column, some\\ntraders reportedly split the profit from a\\ntrade into two columns. The first column\\nreflected the portion of the actual profits\\nthe trader intended to add to Enron's cur-rent\\nfinancial statements. The second col-umn,\\nironically labeled the 'prudency'\\nreserve, included the remainder.\"\\nPartnoy told the committee that in\\nhis estimation, \"Enron's 'prudency'\\nreserves did not depict economic reality,\\nnor could they have been intended to do\\nso.

It sounds like MISO will offer a way to handle losses financially.  Based on their previously filed tariff, it appeared that they would not, but it seems they have reconsidered and recently filed a new Attachment M that details how they will handle losses financially.  I have not yet seen the new Attachment M, so it may be a complex or costly process, but hopefully, it will be fine.\\n\\nNow, for the Important Question.  MISO does not believe they will be able to process third-party loss schedules (either INT or EXT, in Tag parlance) on Dec 15.  I don't think this is an issue for us (I expect we will typically be either accounting for losses financially or through in-kind schedules (dropping off losses along the path).\\n\\nIf this is not correct, and we do sometimes schedule in losses under separate transactions, please let me know ASAP.  Also let me know how prevalent that practice is.  MISO is trying to figure out how urgent the need is to accommodate that on Dec 15.  While they don't believe they will be able to meet that deadline, they want to know how many resources they should allocate to addressing the problem.\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nAndy Rodriquez\\nRegulatory Affairs - Enron Corp.\\nandy.rodriquez@enron.com\\n713-345-3771    \n",

We should not rely on the PX to tell us what the level is. We \\nshould confirm it ourselves.  A skeptical regulator, looking at PX records \\nshould never be able to see that we ever did more than half our block forward \\nbusiness as financial.  \\nOne of the legal rules that we must comply with in this area is that there \\nmust be a bona fide commercial reason for going financial.  This \\ndumbfoundingly simple sounding rule is important.  Somehow, when we \\ncommunicate our decision to the PX to go from physical to financial, we \\nshould give our reason.  I'm not sure whether our decision is expressed by \\nphone, or electronically, but in either case,  the person making the change \\nwith the PX should get in an expression something like this:  \"we would like \\nto change these trades to financial because we think the elimination of \\nphysical risk will benefit us commercially.\"  Please be patient with this \\nself serving requirement and do it. \\n\\n I have not worked out with any of the other back office groups how this new \\npractice will be handled. Obviously any changes it will require in \\nscheduling, settlements and accounting need to be dealt with too. Please call \\nme with any questions.  ----cgy \\n   \n",

All rights reserved.\" WASHINGTO=\\nN -- The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, in one of the first fraud=\\n cases ever filed against a Big Five accounting firm, fined Arthur Andersen=\\n LLP and three partners more than $7-million (U.S.) in connection with audi=\\nts of Waste Management Inc.'s annual financial results.=20\\nIn a complaint filed in U.S. District Court here, the SEC alleged that Arth=\\nur Andersen and its partners allowed Waste Management to continue for sever=\\nal years a series of improper accounting practices that inflated the garbag=\\ne-hauling concern's earnings. The complaint alleges fraud on the part of th=\\nree audit partners assigned to the Waste Management account: Robert Allgyer=\\n, 56 years old, of Lake Forest, Ill., who has retired; Walter Cercavschi, 4=\\n5, of Harwood Heights, Ill.; and Edward Maier, 54, of Chicago.=20\\nArthur Anderson agreed to pay the fine to settle the case, but the firm and=\\n the auditors don't admit or deny the allegations. Among the audit partners=\\n, Mr. Allgyer agreed to pay $50,000, Mr. Maier, $40,000, and Mr. Cercavschi=\\n, $30,000. Arthur Andersen agreed to pay $7-million.  As part of a campaign=\\n to curb what it sees as growing accounting fraud, the SEC has broadened a =\\nnumber of investigations of companies' earnings reports to include audit wo=\\nrk done by outside accountants.  In bringing the first fraud case against a=\\nny audit firm since 1985, SEC enforcement chief Richard Walker said the act=\\nion \"helps to underscore the importance of auditors as gatekeepers to our c=\\napital markets and shows the SEC won't shy away from making auditors comply=\\n with their responsibilities.\"  Under a related administrative proceeding f=\\niled yesterday alleging professional misconduct, the SEC also censured Arth=\\nur Andersen, the three audit partners and a fourth partner, Robert Kutsenda=\\n, who was the regional audit director at the time of the alleged violations=\\n. As part of the censure, the four audit partners are barred from doing acc=\\nounting work for public companies for a period of one to five years.  \"This=\\n settlement allows the firm and its partners to close a very difficult chap=\\nter and move on,\" said Terry Hatchett, Arthur Andersen's managing partner-N=\\north America. \"The SEC has not questioned the underlying quality or effecti=\\nveness of our overall audit methodology, nor has the SEC limited our abilit=\\ny to conduct audits for other public companies.\"  An attorney for Mr. Allgy=\\ner declined to comment. Attorneys for Mr. Maier, Mr. Cercavschi and Mr. Kut=\\nsenda didn't return phone calls.  Waste Management said it \"has co-operated=\\n fully with the SEC in the investigation, and does not believe that the SEC=\\n will seek any action against Waste Management in connection with the event=\\ns detailed in the Arthur Andersen settlement.\"  The Waste Management accoun=\\nting scandal stands out for it size and breadth. After a board-led probe tu=\\nrned up years of questionable accounting, the company took a $3.5-billion c=\\nharge in 1998, and since then the trash hauler and Arthur Andersen agreed t=\\no pay $220-million to settle shareholder litigation in the matter.  The com=\\npany admitted it had overstated its pretax earnings by $1.43-billion in 199=\\n2 to 1996 -- the biggest restatement in SEC history. Neither Waste Manageme=\\nnt nor any of its employees have been disciplined by the SEC. The SEC said =\\nyesterday that the investigation continues.  Within the SEC, the Arthur And=\\nerson investigation became a centrepiece of the commission's aggressive cam=\\npaign to demonstrate that conflicts of interest can be caused by consulting=\\n and other non-auditing services that numerous accounting firms now routine=\\nly offer audit clients. =09\\n   \n",
